# Conditional GET

Weak ETags are generated by expressjs by default. 

To enable strong ETags in expressjs:

```
app.set('etag', 'strong')
```

When the ETags are enabled, any get requests with headers `If-None-Match` with the ETag values from the previous request (don't forget to include the opening/closing quotes as they are part of the ETags) will return a response with Status 304 Not Modified.

```
Status: 304 Not Modified
If-None-Match: "b-gjgNHiY7YJPzx1NWkPzddQ"
```
